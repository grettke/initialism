;;; Commentary:

;; *This tool makes memorizing scripts and speeches easier!*
;;
;; Why struggle with the tedious and error-prone task of creating
;; initialisms for an entire script by hand? This program does it
;; with impeccable precision for you every time, allowing you to
;; format the output to your liking. Experience the ease and
;; convenience for yourselfâ€•your brain will love it!
