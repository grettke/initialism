* Usage

In this example create an initialism from the phrase "Eventually Munches All
Computer Storage".

Start by positioning the Cursor at the start of the first word. Call
~initialism-dispatch~. Notice that the value of the initialism appears in the
Echo Area, and the Cursor moves one step forward. Call ~initialism-dispatch~
again, and the Cursor moves, but nothing appears in the Echo Area. You can't make
an initialism using whitespace characters, so it is ignored. Call
~initialism-dispatch~ noting that the current initialism value is again
displayed in the Echo Area, and the Cursor moves forward, this time with an
additional character appended. Call
~initialism-dispatch~, and the space character is then ignored. As you repeatedly
call ~initialism-dispatch~, you can watch the initialism built until you finally
reach the end of the line, and I don't know how to proceed.

/@ represents the cursor location/

#+begin_src text
@Eventually Munches All Computer Storage
(E)
Eventually @Munches All Computer Storage
(EM)
Eventually Munches @All Computer Storage
(EMA)
Eventually Munches All @Computer Storage
(EMAC)
Eventually Munches All Computer @Storage
(EMACS)
#+end_src

Indeed, now you must ask yourself, "But why can’t you handle the end-of-line
character, my dear system?" The answer is simple: it makes it easy for you to
create initialism starting from wherever you like, skipping, or whatever you
wish; there are no limits on the source of your initialism. Therefore, I assume
nothing beyond the fact that initialism is built using only the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Char-Classes.html#Char-Classes][Character
Classes]] =[[:alnum:]]= and =[[:punct:]]=

Review the initialism value by calling ~C-u initialism-dispatch~ and noting in
the Echo Area.

#+begin_src text
(EMACS)
#+end_src

Insert the initialism value by calling ~C-u C-u initialism-dispatch~.

#+begin_src text
/@\
/(EMACS)\
#+end_src

If you don't like the format of the initialism you can modify it yourself. Behind
the scenes the actual initialism data, the /Model/, is stored in a private
variable that you will never touch. What you actually see presented from that
data, the /View/, is the result of formatting the /Model/ with
~initialism-format-string~ where the /Model/ is the argument.

It's important to understand that the format of the initialism is separate from
the data itself. The actual initialism data, the /Model/, is stored in a private
variable that you won't need to touch. What you see presented from that data,
the /View/, is the result of formatting the /Model with the
~initialism-format-string~, which you can modify to your liking.

Consider this example so far.

- The /Model/: EMACS
- The /View/: (EMACS)

Imagine that you want to format the initialism as bold text in LaTeX without
parentheses around it. Use ~customize~ to customize ~initialism-format-string~
with =\textbf{%s}= and you now end up with

- The /Model/: EMACS
- The /View/: =\textbf{EMACS}=

Delete the initialism value by calling ~C-u C-u C-u initialism-dispatch~ and
note in the Echo Area the message.

#+begin_src text
(initialism) View deleted.
#+end_src

This example reflects the typical workflow building an initialism. Call
~initialism-help~ to review the workflow. If you want to call the individual
functions for each workflow step, you'll also find their names too.

Now start creating your next initialism.

* Is It An Initialism, Acronym, or Abbreviation?

- What is the difference between an acronym and an initialism?
  - Both acronyms and initialisms are made up of the first letter or letters
    of the words in a phrase. The word /acronym/ typically applies when the
    resulting thing can be read as a word; for example, /radar/ comes from
    "𝙧𝙖dio 𝙙etection 𝙖nd 𝙧anging" and /scuba/ comes from
    "𝙨elf-𝙘ontained 𝙪nderwater 𝙗reathing 𝙖pparatus." The word
    /initialism/ only applies when the resulting thing is read as an
    abbreviation; for example /DIY/, which comes from "𝙙o 𝙞t
    𝙮ourself," is pronounced by saying the names of the letters. Note that
    the word /acronym/ is also sometimes used to mean "initialism."
- What is the difference between an acronym and an abbreviation?
  - An acronym is a kind of abbreviation. Abbreviations can be shortened
    forms of any kind. For example, /appt/ is an abbreviation of
    /appointment/, and /ASAP/ is an abbreviation of 𝙖s 𝙨oon 𝙖s 𝙥ossible.
    /ASAP/, however, also qualifies as an acronym because it is made up of
    the initial letters of the phrase it comes from: 𝙖s 𝙨oon 𝙖s 𝙥ossible.

    - Is OK an acronym?
      - /OK/ is technically an acronym. It comes from the phrase "oll korrect," a
        humorous alteration of "all correct."

  - Did you know?
    - What's the difference between an /abbreviation/ and an /acronym/?
      - Some people are unsure of whether to call /ASAP/ or /appt/ abbreviations or
        acronyms. Both /abbreviation/ and /acronym/ are used to refer to a shortened
        form, but an acronym is a shortened form of a phrase and is usually made
        up of the initial letters of that phrase. For example, /NATO/ comes from
        "North Atlantic Treaty Organization," and /ASAP/ comes from "as soon as
        possible." Abbreviations, on the other hand, can be shortened forms of
        words or phrases, and need not necessarily be made up of the initial
        letters of either. /ASAP/ and /appt/ (for /appointment/) are both considered
        abbreviations, but only /ASAP/ is an acronym. Acronyms are a type of
        abbreviation.
