* Usage
* Is It An Initialism, Acronym, or Abbreviation?

- What is the difference between an acronym and an initialism?
  - Both acronyms and initialisms are made up of the first letter or letters
    of the words in a phrase. The word /acronym/ typically applies when the
    resulting thing can be read as a word; for example, /radar/ comes from
    "𝙧𝙖dio 𝙙etection 𝙖nd 𝙧anging" and /scuba/ comes from
    "𝙨elf-𝙘ontained 𝙪nderwater 𝙗reathing 𝙖pparatus." The word
    /initialism/ only applies when the resulting thing is read as an
    abbreviation; for example /DIY/, which comes from "𝙙o 𝙞t
    𝙮ourself," is pronounced by saying the names of the letters. Note that
    the word /acronym/ is also sometimes used to mean "initialism."
- What is the difference between an acronym and an abbreviation?
  - An acronym is a kind of abbreviation. Abbreviations can be shortened
    forms of any kind. For example, /appt/ is an abbreviation of
    /appointment/, and /ASAP/ is an abbreviation of 𝙖s 𝙨oon 𝙖s 𝙥ossible.
    /ASAP/, however, also qualifies as an acronym because it is made up of
    the initial letters of the phrase it comes from: 𝙖s 𝙨oon 𝙖s 𝙥ossible.

  - Did you know?
    - What's the difference between an /abbreviation/ and an /acronym/?
      - Some people are unsure of whether to call /ASAP/ or /appt/ abbreviations or
        acronyms. Both /abbreviation/ and /acronym/ are used to refer to a shortened
        form, but an acronym is a shortened form of a phrase and is usually made
        up of the initial letters of that phrase. For example, /NATO/ comes from
        "North Atlantic Treaty Organization," and /ASAP/ comes from "as soon as
        possible." Abbreviations, on the other hand, can be shortened forms of
        words or phrases, and need not necessarily be made up of the initial
        letters of either. /ASAP/ and /appt/ (for /appointment/) are both considered
        abbreviations, but only /ASAP/ is an acronym. Acronyms are a type of
        abbreviation.
